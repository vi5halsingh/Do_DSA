# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains JavaScript implementations of common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and patterns. I'd like you to contribute here with best of your knowledge of DSA so let's help other's by contributing here ! Thanks

## Structure

- `Array/` – Array manipulation problems
- `patterns/` – Pattern printing problems
- `sorting/` – Sorting algorithms
- `script.js` – Example script for array arrangement

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [`prompt-sync`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-sync) for user input in console programs

## Setup

Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

Run any script using Node.js. For example:
```sh
node patterns/tringle.js
```

Some scripts require user input in the terminal.

## Notes

- All code is written in JavaScript.
- This repo is for learning and practicing DSA concepts.
